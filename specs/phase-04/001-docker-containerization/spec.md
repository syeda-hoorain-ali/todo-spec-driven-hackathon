# Feature Specification: Docker Containerization for Todo Chatbot Application

**Feature Branch**: `phase-04/001-docker-containerization`
**Created**: 2026-01-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "now write specifications for it"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Containerize Todo Chatbot Application (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I want to containerize the Todo Chatbot application (frontend on port 3000, backend on port 8000, and MCP server on port 8080) so that I can deploy it consistently across different environments (dev, staging, prod) using Docker and Kubernetes.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational requirement for the entire deployment pipeline. Without containerization, the application cannot be deployed to Kubernetes environments, which is a core requirement of the project.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by building Docker images for each component and running them in containers. The containers should start successfully and the applications should be accessible via their respective ports (3000, 8000, 8080), delivering the core functionality of the Todo Chatbot application.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Docker is installed and configured, **When** I run `docker build` for each component, **Then** Docker images are created successfully for frontend, backend, and MCP server
2. **Given** Docker images exist for all components, **When** I run `docker run` for each component, **Then** containers start and applications are accessible via their respective ports (frontend: 3000, backend: 8000, MCP server: 8080)

### User Story 2 - Use Docker AI Agent for Containerization (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I want to use Docker AI Agent (Gordon) for Dockerfile creation and optimization so that I can leverage AI assistance to create efficient and secure Dockerfiles.

**Why this priority**: This enhances developer productivity and ensures Dockerfiles follow best practices by leveraging AI assistance, which is specifically mentioned in the requirements.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by using Docker AI Agent to generate or optimize Dockerfiles, then verifying that the generated Dockerfiles follow security and performance best practices and successfully build images.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Docker AI Agent is available, **When** I ask Gordon to create Dockerfiles, **Then** optimized Dockerfiles are generated following security best practices
2. **Given** Dockerfiles exist, **When** I ask Gordon to rate or optimize them, **Then** suggestions for improvement are provided and implemented

---

### User Story 3 - Implement Multi-Stage Docker Builds (Priority: P3)

As a DevOps engineer, I want to implement multi-stage Docker builds for all components so that I can optimize image sizes and improve security by separating build and runtime environments.

**Why this priority**: This improves security and deployment efficiency by reducing image sizes and minimizing the attack surface in production containers.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that Dockerfiles implement multi-stage builds with separate stages for dependencies, build, and production, resulting in smaller final images.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Multi-stage Dockerfiles are implemented, **When** I build Docker images, **Then** images are smaller than single-stage builds and only contain necessary runtime dependencies
2. **Given** Multi-stage Dockerfiles exist, **When** I run containers, **Then** applications function correctly in production environment

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Docker AI Agent (Gordon) is not available in the user's region?
- How does the system handle different base image versions for different components?
- What if environment variables are missing during container startup?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST containerize the Next.js frontend application using Docker
- **FR-002**: System MUST containerize the FastAPI backend application using Docker
- **FR-003**: System MUST containerize the MCP server application using Docker
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement multi-stage Docker builds for all components
- **FR-005**: System MUST use Docker AI Agent (Gordon) for Dockerfile creation and optimization where available
- **FR-006**: System MUST configure appropriate environment variables for all containers
- **FR-007**: System MUST use non-root users in all containers for security
- **FR-008**: System MUST implement Docker Hardened Images (DHI) where available for enhanced security
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide Docker Compose configuration for local development
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure all containers expose the correct ports for communication (frontend: 3000, backend: 8000, MCP server: 8080)
- **FR-011**: System MUST use specific, pinned base image versions (node:24.11.1-alpine, python:3.12-slim) for consistency and security
- **FR-012**: System MUST implement health checks (liveness and readiness probes) for all containers in Kubernetes
- **FR-013**: System MUST support environment-specific configurations for dev, staging, and production environments

### Key Entities

- **Frontend Container**: Next.js application container with Node.js runtime (node:24.11.1-alpine), serving the user interface on port 3000
- **Backend Container**: FastAPI application container with Python runtime (python:3.12-slim), providing API services on port 8000
- **MCP Server Container**: MCP server application container, providing Model Context Protocol services on port 8080
- **Docker Images**: Optimized container images with specific, pinned base image versions for each component with minimal attack surface
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration parameters for each container to connect with other services, supporting dev, staging, and production environments
- **Health Checks**: Liveness and readiness probes implemented for all containers to ensure proper operation in Kubernetes
- **Deployment Configurations**: Docker Compose for local development and Kubernetes manifests for production deployment

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Docker images for all components are built successfully with no errors
- **SC-002**: All containers start and applications are accessible within 30 seconds of startup
- **SC-003**: Final production images are optimized to under 200MB for frontend and 150MB for backend
- **SC-004**: Docker AI Agent (Gordon) successfully generates or optimizes Dockerfiles for all components
- **SC-005**: All containers run with non-root users as verified by container inspection
- **SC-006**: Applications maintain full functionality when running in containers as compared to local development

## Clarifications

### Session 2026-01-01

- Q: What base image versions should be used for consistency and security? → A: Use specific, pinned base image versions (e.g., node:24.11.1-alpine, python:3.12-slim) for all containers to ensure consistency and security
