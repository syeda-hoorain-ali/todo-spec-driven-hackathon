Completed comprehensive planning for the task management frontend, including implementation plan, research on form handling with react-hook-form and Zod, data models, API contracts, and quickstart guide, all aligned with Next.js best practices.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete implementation plan with research, data models, API contracts, and quickstart guide for task management frontend
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created multiple planning documents for the feature
- 🔁 Next prompts: Implementation of the planned components following the spec and plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Planning phase established clear roadmap for frontend development with proper form handling and Next.js patterns

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
