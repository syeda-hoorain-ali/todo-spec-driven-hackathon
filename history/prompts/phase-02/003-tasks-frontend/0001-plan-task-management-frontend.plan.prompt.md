- 📁 Files: Created spec file and PHR record
- 🔁 Next prompts: Implementation of the planned components
- 🧠 Reflection: Planning phase established clear roadmap for frontend development with all required features

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): not applicable
- Prompt variant (if applicable): not applicable
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementing the planned components following the specification
