# MCP Server Expert Agent Development

## Prompt

Create an MCP server expert agent that can connect any kind of MCP server with OpenAI Agents SDK's agent, with appropriate skills for different transport methods and scenarios.

## Response

Developed a comprehensive MCP server expert agent with specialized skills for different transport methods:

1. Created the main agent configuration (.claude/agents/mcp-server-expert-agent.md) with:
   - Detailed system prompt focusing on skill usage
   - Configuration for 6 specialized skills
   - Clear guidelines for transport method selection

2. Created 6 specialized skills:
   - hosted-mcp-server: For publicly accessible servers using OpenAI's infrastructure
   - streamable-http-mcp-server: For HTTP-based server connections
   - mcp-server-sse: For Server-Sent Events transport
   - mcp-server-stdio: For local subprocess communication
   - mcp-server-troubleshooting: For diagnosing and fixing connection issues
   - mcp-server-discovery: For researching and finding connection details for specific services

3. Each skill includes:
   - Accurate parameter documentation
   - Proper usage context
   - Working code examples
   - Configuration options

4. The agent follows a skill-based approach where it selects the most appropriate skill based on user requirements rather than having all information in the system prompt.

## Outcome

Successfully created a modular, comprehensive MCP server expert agent system that can handle all types of MCP server connections with OpenAI Agents SDK. The agent is capable of:
- Connecting to different types of MCP servers using appropriate transport methods
- Troubleshooting connection issues
- Discovering connection details for specific services
- Providing accurate configuration guidance
- Following best practices for each transport method
