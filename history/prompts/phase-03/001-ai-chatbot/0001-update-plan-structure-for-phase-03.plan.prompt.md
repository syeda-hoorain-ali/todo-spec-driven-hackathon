## Prompt

Update the plan structure to reflect copying Phase-02 completely and integrating chatbot functionality, with ChatKit React component on dashboard page.

## Response snapshot

Updated the implementation plan to reflect copying Phase-02 structure to Phase-03 and extending with chatbot functionality. Updated the folder structure to show the correct approach of copying the entire Phase-02 structure and adding chatbot components. The structure now properly reflects: 1) Copying Phase-02 completely to Phase-03, 2) Adding chat interface integrated into the existing dashboard page, 3) Using ChatKit React for the chat component, 4) Adding backend agents and MCP tools for AI functionality.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Plan structure now accurately reflects the intended architecture based on copying Phase-02 and extending with chatbot functionality
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: specs/phase-03/001-ai-chatbot/plan.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks to generate implementation tasks based on updated plan
- 🧠 Reflection: The plan now correctly represents the approach of building upon the existing Phase-02 architecture while adding AI chatbot capabilities through ChatKit React and MCP server integration.
