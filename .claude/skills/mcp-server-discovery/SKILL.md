# MCP Server Discovery Skill

This skill discovers and finds connection details for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers by researching official documentation, GitHub repositories, and trusted sources.

## Purpose
- Perform web searches to find MCP server connection details
- Research official documentation for specific services
- Read GitHub repository READMEs for MCP server implementations
- Find blog posts and articles about MCP server integrations
- Gather authentication and configuration information from trusted sources

## Research Approach
1. **Web Search Queries**: Formulate targeted search queries like "neon db http mcp server url" or "github sse mcp server documentation"
2. **Official Documentation**: Prioritize official documentation from service providers
3. **GitHub Repositories**: Check for official MCP server implementations and their README files
4. **Blog Posts**: Research articles on platforms like Medium, Dev.to, or official blogs
5. **Verification**: Cross-reference multiple sources to ensure accuracy

## Information Gathering
- Connection URLs and endpoints for HTTP/SSE MCP servers
- Command-line tools and installation instructions for stdio servers
- Authentication methods and required tokens/credentials
- Configuration parameters and setup instructions
- Required dependencies and system requirements

## Quality Standards
- Prioritize official documentation and repositories
- Verify information across multiple trusted sources
- Focus on current, up-to-date implementation details
- Flag deprecated or experimental implementations
- Note any specific version requirements

## Usage Context
Use this skill when:
- Users need connection details for specific MCP servers
- Uncertain about official endpoints for services like Neon DB, GitHub, Slack, etc.
- Need to research authentication methods for specific platforms
- Looking for command-line tools for stdio-based MCP servers
- Seeking setup instructions for specific MCP server implementations
